# In computer programming, comments are used to provide hints, explanations, or notes within the code.  
# They help make the code more understandable and maintainable for developers.  

# Comments are completely ignored by the interpreter and have no effect on the program's execution.  

# Types of Comments in Python:
# 1. Single-line Comments
# 2. Multi-line Comments

print("I am revising the concept of comments.")

# Example of a single-line comment:
# The following lines of code are commented out and won't be executed.
# print("Hello")
# print("World")
# print("2")

# Example of multi-line comments:

However, the standard and preferred way to write multi-line comments is by using triple double quotes (""").
