# Escape characters or sequences are special characters in Python that enable certain behaviors, 
# such as formatting the output. They never appear as part of the printed output but alter how 
# the output is displayed.

# Common Escape Characters:
# \'  -> Single quotation
# \"  -> Double quotation
# \\  -> Backslash
# \n  -> New line
# \t  -> Tab
# \r  -> Carriage return
# \b  -> Backspace  

# Example: Using \n to print a new line in the output.
print("Hello world\nI am revising Python concepts")

# Escape sequences do not appear in the output but perform specific tasks.

# Practice Questions:
print("My name is Uzair\nMy age is 20\nMy gender is Male")  # Using \n for new lines
print("My name is Uzair\tMy age is 20")                    # Using \t for tabs
print("My name is \"Sheikh Uzair Raza\"")                  # Using \" for double quotes
print("My name is \'Sheikh Uzair Raza\'")                  # Using \' for single quotes
print("My name is Sheikh Uzair Raza a\nd My age is 20")    # Using \n for a new line
